- Sunday Worship 10 a.m.
introduction:
- St. David's Reformed Church is located in NW Houston (Tomball) and is affiliated
  with the [Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches](http://www.crechurches.org/).
- We believe that the Bible is God's holy and infallible word and that it is the ultimate
  rule of faith and life.
- Our doctrines and convictions are based on historic Protestant orthodoxy as summarized
  in the historic Christian creeds and Reformed confessions.
- As evangelicals, we look forward to the day when the knowledge of the Lord will
  cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. We believe that every thought will
  be brought captive to Christ as we live faithfully in our families, communities,
  and nation.
- Visit us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/saintdavidshouston) for announcements,
  sermon links, and more!
about:
- Our liturgy is based on heavenly worship as described in Scripture. We sing psalms
  and hymns, confess our sins, and share communion every week. We believe that communion
  is a weekly renewal of our fellowship with God and with our brothers and sisters
  in Christ. Communion is open to all faithful, baptized trinitarians (including children).
- Immediately after worship, we have a brief time of fellowship, and then a Sunday
  School class (all ages) is held from 11:30-12:15. On the last Sunday of each month,
  instead of Sunday School we have a singing and prayer service. This is a time to
  learn new songs and share prayer requests. Please join us!
