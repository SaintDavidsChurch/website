introduction:
- "Due to Covid-19 precautions, we are currently meeting for worship by reservation\
  \ only. This allows us to prepare seating and communion arrangements. If you would\
  \ like to visit us for worship, please contact us by phone or email by Friday.\r\
  \n\r\nSaint David's Church is located in the northwest Houston area (Tomball) and\
  \ is affiliated with the [Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches](http://www.crechurches.org/)."
- We believe that the Bible is God's holy and infallible word and that it is the ultimate
  rule of faith and life.
- Our doctrines and convictions are based on historic Protestant orthodoxy as summarized
  in the historic Christian creeds and Reformed confessions.
- As evangelicals, we look forward to the day when the knowledge of the Lord will
  cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. We believe that every thought will
  be brought captive to Christ as we live faithfully in our families, communities,
  and nation.
about:
- Our liturgy is based on heavenly worship as described in Scripture. We sing psalms
  and hymns, confess our sins, and share communion every week. We believe that communion
  is a weekly renewal of our fellowship with God and with our brothers and sisters
  in Christ. Communion is open to all faithful, baptized trinitarians.
- Immediately after worship, we have a brief time for coffee and fellowship, and then
  a Sunday School class (all ages) is held from 11:30-12:15. On the last Sunday of
  each month, instead of Sunday School we have a singing and prayer service. This
  is a time to learn new songs and share prayer requests.
- We host a lunch every Sunday after our services. This is a time for us to have continued
  fellowship with another. Please join us!
