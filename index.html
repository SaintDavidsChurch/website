    <p>Saint David's Church is located in the northwest Houston area (Tomball) and is affiliated with the <a
            href="http://www.crechurches.org/">Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches</a>.</p>
    <p>We believe that the Bible is God's holy and infallible word and that it is the ultimate rule of faith and life.
    </p>
    <p>Our doctrines and convictions are based on historic Protestant orthodoxy as summarized in the historic Christian
        creeds and Reformed confessions.</p>
    <p>As evangelicals, we look forward to the day when the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters
        cover the sea. We believe that every thought will be brought captive to Christ as we live faithfully in our
        families, communities, and nation.</p>

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Our liturgy is historical and we sing psalms and hymns, confess our sins, and share Communion every
                    week.</p>
                <p>We believe that Communion is a weekly renewal of our fellowship with God and with our brothers and
                    sisters in Christ that commits us to the Lord and to each other for the coming week. Our Communion
                    is open to all who are baptized in the Triune Name and are not under church discipline. In the
                    spirit of Communion we have a fellowship meal immediately following worship every week.</p>
